text1 = f"""You are analyzing an emergency call transcript. Your task is to extract and summarize the three most critical pieces of information from the call. Focus only on essential details, and **omit any extraneous or irrelevant information**, such as mentions of relationships or unnecessary repetition of urgency. Specifically:

1. The nature of the emergency or danger.
2. Any critical health conditions or relevant medical history.
3. Any environmental hazards (e.g., electrical hazards, fire, dangerous surroundings).
4. Other important symptoms or events leading up to the emergency.

The summary must consist of **three sentences**, each limited to 5-6 words. Avoid unnecessary personal references and focus only on the core details that are medically or contextually important. Include environmental hazards if they are relevant to the situation.

Here is the transcript:Â
